\BackTitle{Natural causes of language}
\BackBody{This book explores a causal framework for understanding the ontology of language systems, grounded in three core ideas. The first is that causal processes apply in multiple frames or `time scalesâ€™ simultaneously, and we need to understand and address each and all of these frames equally in our work on language. Second, a bit of language will only exist if it has successfully been diffused and kept in circulation through social interaction in the history of a community. Third, bits of language are always parts of systems, and so we need to show how it is that mobile items of knowledge and behavior form up into structured wholes. This book suggests a conceptual framework for explaining, in causal terms, what languages are like and why they are like that.
